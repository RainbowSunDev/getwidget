 ## Documentation
 
  [**Installation Guide**](https://docs.getflutter.dev)
 
[**NOTE**] Our library will also work on flutter web but since flutter didn't released stable version for Flutter web and it is still in Beta release so you might get some rendering problem and hence we will update our library as flutter comes with the stable release for Flutter Web.
